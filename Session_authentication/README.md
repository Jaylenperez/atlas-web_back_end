This project focuses on implementing session authentication from scratch without the use of external libraries. It covers key concepts such as session management, cookies, and Flask-based session handling to provide a deeper understanding of authentication mechanisms. The goal is to build a secure and functional session authentication system, while adhering to best practices in Python development.
