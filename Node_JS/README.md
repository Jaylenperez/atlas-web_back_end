## :memo: <span id="description">Description</span>

This project walks you through building and organizing Node and Express applications from scratch. You will learn how to run JavaScript with NodeJS, work with built-in modules (including file and process APIs), and create HTTP servers using both Node's native HTTP module and the Express framework. Along the way, you'll leverage modern JavaScript features with Babel, speed up development with Nodemon, and write tests with Mocha and Jest.
