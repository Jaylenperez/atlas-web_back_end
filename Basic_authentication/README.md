This project focuses on learning the fundamentals of the authentication process by implementing a Basic Authentication mechanism in a simple API using Python and Flask. It provides a step-by-step exploration of key concepts such as encoding strings in Base64, using the HTTP Authorization header, and managing user authentication and authorization. The project emphasizes understanding these principles through hands-on coding while adhering to clean, documented, and pycodestyle-compliant Python code.
